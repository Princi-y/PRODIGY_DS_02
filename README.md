This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among the variables. The analysis is divided into two major sections:

1. Univariate Analysis
Graphical Analysis:
Visualized individual variables using bar plots, histograms, and pie charts to understand their distributions and key statistics.
Non-Graphical Analysis:
Summarized data with descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, and frequency distributions.
2. Multivariate Analysis
Graphical Analysis:
Explored relationships between multiple variables using scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.
Non-Graphical Analysis:
Analyzed correlations, cross-tabulations, and statistical summaries to understand the interactions between variables.
